# Directory Traversal

## Summary
- **Author:** Zavier Lee

## Description
I made a simple web server that serves files from the 'static' directory, you shouldn't be able to break out of this directory... I think...

Anyway, I hid a surprise for you at `app.py`, it's just one level up from the 'static' directory, but I'm sure you won't be able to find it.
